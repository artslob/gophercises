# Exercise 9 - "Deck of Cards"

View on [gophercises.com](https://gophercises.com/exercises/deck).

## Description
In this exercise we are going to create a package that can be used to build decks of cards.

We  will include following topics:

1. Sorting (using the [sort](https://golang.org/pkg/sort/) package)
2. Shuffling with permutations (using the [math/rand](https://golang.org/pkg/math/rand/) package)
3. `go generate` with [stringer](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer)
4. Functional options (for practice)

Along the way we will also learn a little bit about constants, iota, and other aspects of using Go.

_NOTE: We will be using this package in the next two Gophercises exercises_
