# gophercises

This repository contains my solutions to exercises from [gophercises.com](https://gophercises.com/).

_Note: in README files I provided only short version of exercise description. Full versions are hosted
freely on [gophercises.com](https://gophercises.com/). To gain access to them you need to sign up,
but its really easy: only email is required, no password.  
Also this exercises can be used to train any language, not only Go.  
So I advise you to sign up. Good luck!_
