# gophercises

This repository contains my solutions to exercises from [gophercises.com](https://gophercises.com/).

_Note: in README files I provided only short version of exercise description. Full versions are hosted
freely on [gophercises.com](https://gophercises.com/). To gain access to them you need to sign up,
but its really easy: only email is required, no password.  
Also this exercises can be used to train any language, not only Go.  
So I advise you to sign up. Good luck!_

Each solution has separate folder:
1. [Quiz Game](../../tree/master/01-quiz)
2. [URL Shortener](../../tree/master/02-urlshort)
2. [Choose Your Own Adventure](../../tree/master/03-cyoa)
