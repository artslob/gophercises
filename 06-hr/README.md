# Exercise 6 - "Hacker Rank Problem"

View on [gophercises.com](https://gophercises.com/exercises/hr1).

## Description
The goal of this exercise is to get you familiar with how to solve problems on the website
HackerRank website.

The first problem we will be looking at is named
[camelcase](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/camelcase/problem),
and in the problem our goal is to find out how many words were used to create a camelcase string.

The second problem,
[caesar cipher](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/caesar-cipher-1/problem),
involves encrypting a string using a fairly basic cipher where you are changing the ascii value of
each character.

To do this problem on your own you simply need to try to solve each problem and submit
a solution to Hacker Rank to verify that it passes *all* of the test cases - not just the sample
ones you can run before submitting.
