# Exercise 10 - "Blackjack"

View on [gophercises.com](https://gophercises.com/exercises/blackjack).

## Description
**Note:** This exercise will use the completed code from the
[Deck of Cards Exercise](https://gophercises.com/exercises/blackjack).

Now that we have a deck of cards to work with, we want to build something using the cards.
Blackjack is a relatively simple card game with a simple AI, so that will be the focus of this exercise.
We won't be building out all of the rules, but we will implement the major ones and you are welcome to
expand upon the game once you have it working.
